# The content of this file is partly autogenerated
# You can modify values and add settings for your blueprints
# Common settings available for all blueprints are:
#     ignored: [True|False]
#     version: some version
#     # use the same url as defined for the target but checks out a different branch
#     branch: str
#     patchLevel: int
#     buildType: [Release|RelWithDebInfo|Debug] The default is defined by CraftSettings.ini [Compile]BuildType
#     buildTests: [True|False]
#     buildStatic: [True|False]
#     # arguments passed to the configure step
#     args: str
#
# Example:
##     [libs]
##     ignored = True
##
##     [lib/qt5]
##     version = 5.9.3
##     ignored = False
##     withMySQL = True
##
##     [kde/pim/akonadi]
##     args = -DAKONADI_BUILD_QSQLITE=On
##
#
# Settings are inherited, so you can set them for a whole sub branch or a single blueprint.
# While blueprint from [libs] are all ignored blueprint from [libs/qt5] are not.
